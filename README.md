# Mapping_Earthquakes  

## Project Overview  
Create data visuals with Leafleat Javascript and Mapbox styling to map out the locations and magnitudes of earthquakes across the globe. The data visuals will consist of three layers of different map types with three overlays of data included.  

## Maps  
1. Street -a comprehensive, general-purpose map that emphasizes accurate, legible styling of road and transit.  
2. Satelite street -a global basemap of high resolution satellite imagery and road and transit lines.  
3. Dark -designed to provide geographic context while highlighting the data on the overlay.  

## Overlay
1. Earthquake -shows the locations and magnitudes of all earthquakes within the last seven days.  
2. Tectonic Plates -marks the fault lines of the tectonic plates across the globe.
3. Major earthquakes -displays all high magnitude earthquakes. 
  
## Summary  
An interactive data map was designed to visualize the areas where earthquakes appear with comparison to the tectonic plates. The magitudes are shown in the color and size as well as a popup box with magnitude information. Data was extracted from earthquake.usgs.gov and githubusercontent.com.
